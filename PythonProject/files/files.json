In India, the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature is very, very demanding. Therefore, the Executive has to orient itself to the requirement of the Legislature, and at times, it has to adapt to the demand resulting in the need for reforms. Likewise, the Legislature also has to make amends sometime so that it becomes easier for the Executive to implement the laws passed by the Parliament. In order to understand the fine nuances of parliamentary procedure and practice and orient the respondents, PARI has brought out certain capacity-building courses on Parliamentary procedure, which enable the stakeholders to deal with the Parliament efficiently. The capacity-building courses are tailor-made for officers of the ministries/departments/PSUs."
